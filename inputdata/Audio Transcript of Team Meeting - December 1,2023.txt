[00:30] Alice: Okay, moving on. Carol, you had some designs to show us?

[00:33] Carol: Yep, here are three new proposals for the app interface. [Papers rustling]

[00:40] Bob: I like the second one, but can we tweak the color scheme?

[00:43] Carol: Sure, I can work on that.

[00:46] Alice: Sounds like we’re all agreeing on Proposal 2 with Bob’s changes. Now, the marketing strategy for next quarter. David?
